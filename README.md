## How many iterrations will it take /dev/urandom
[how-much-time-takes-to-generate-phrase.bash](bash/how-much-time-takes-to-generate-phrase.bash)
It was interesting for me, how much iterrations will be needed to pass to get some word or password to be generated from `/dev/urandom`. So if sec team asks, "Why this password is not generated?"... So I would be able to answer it is generated, just happened so it looks like a word...
